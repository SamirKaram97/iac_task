## Principles and Best Practices
 SOLID Principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility.

- Open/Closed Principle: The system is open for extension but closed for modification.

- Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules.


Clean code with modular architecture.

Reusable components for UI and logic.
